# Timesheet Helper
 Timesheet Helper for time tracking and uploading to TEMPO.
 
 This allows the user to keep track of their labor charging by allowing for a sequential entry of time with a description and a charge code.  Features include:
 1.	Ability to track one year's worth of entries.
 2. Allows user to put a description for the time charged.
 3. Sums up the hours per charge code on a weekly basis.
 4. Formats and automates uploading to TEMPO, including validation.
 5. Keeps track of vacation and time off hours.
 
 In the past, there have been timecard tools, ex. TimeSTAMP, that have had labor spreading functions.  These functions are against Corporate Policy.  This tool is a labor log tool that gives the user the ability to keep track of their time in a user friendly manner and helps provide the information required if audited.  In addition, this tool takes care of tasks such as calculating time to the nearest tenth of an hour, keeping track of frequently used work packages, keeping track of vacation hours, and automating the upload into TEMPO.  IT DOES NOT SPREAD TIME.

 Ultimately, the employee is responsible for their tracking their time and making sure the information recorded in TEMPO is accurate.
